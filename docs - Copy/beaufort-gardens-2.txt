Beaufort Gardens is a sought-after street in Knightsbridge, lined with grand Victorian townhouses. Most of the properties were built in the 1860s, with stucco porches and classical window dressings. Despite its central location, the square has a sense of privacy and seclusion. From here, both Knightsbridge and South Kensington underground stations are close. Similarly, the celebrated shops and restaurants of Knightsbridge, and the world-class cultural institutions of South Kensington, are both within walking distance. In addition, the open spaces of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park can be easily reached.,
