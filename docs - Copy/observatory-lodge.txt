Observatory Gardens was once the site of an observatory belonging to the astronomer Sir James South, with a dome designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The current street was built in 1883, with red brick houses designed in the Revival style. However, in 1990 these properties were extensively rebuilt, replacing the interiors with luxury flats. Today, the street is exceptionally well positioned. Holland Park and Kensington Gardens are both a short walk away. Kensington High Street is also close, with its celebrated mix of restaurants and shops, as well as an underground station.,
