Turner – Mallord was one of the painter’s middle names – and lined with houses built in the Edwardian and Arts and Crafts style. Over the years it has been home to numerous creative figures, including painters, composers and writers. The most well-known of these was the author A.A. Milne, who created the Winnie the Pooh books. Mallord Street is moments away from the King’s Road, with its celebrated range of restaurants and shops. In addition, Sloane Square and South Kensington underground stations are both within walking distance.,
