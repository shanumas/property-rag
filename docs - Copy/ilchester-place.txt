Read more about the design of this exceptional property here., 

The beautiful red-brick houses on Ilchester Place were built during the interwar years and designed in the neo-Georgian style. Their wide proportions allow for an unusual level of lateral space, as well as a low building frontage for the entire length of the street., 

The Neighbourhood, Ilchester Place is set within the Holland Park Conservation Area and preserves a sense of discretion and calm. However, the local neighbourhood is also well-served by the restaurants, schools and transport links around Kensington High Street.,
