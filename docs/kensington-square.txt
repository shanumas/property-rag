In the nineteenth century, it was home to the artist Edward Burne-Jones, the philosopher John Stuart Mill, and the composer Hubert Parry. It was also home to Heythrop College, a specialist university for philosophy and theology, and the Catholic Convent of the Assumption. In addition, No.27 Kensington Square was a private school, while 27a served as the headmaster’s house. Today, the square is within walking distance of Kensington High Street underground station, as well as the open spaces of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. In addition, the area’s outstanding restaurants, shops and schools are all in easy reach. Thanks to its unique location, the property enjoys a sense of sheltered clam, despite being minutes away from the lively centre of Kensington.
