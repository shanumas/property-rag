Palace Gardens Terrace is a grand street of white stucco town houses running south from Notting Hill Gate. The street is lined with trees, while the houses are set back from the pavement, giving added privacy. From here, the open spaces of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park are a short walk away. In addition, Notting Hill Gate underground station is nearby, while the exclusive restaurants and shops of Kensington High Street are also close.
