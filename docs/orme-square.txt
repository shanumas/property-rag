At present there are no internal walls, providing a series of large lateral spaces that could be used for an open-plan kitchen, a spacious living area, and several well-proportioned ensuite bedrooms. It also has a lift shaft connecting all levels and high ceilings across the ground, first and second floors. 

The house requires complete renovation, offering a blank canvass for an imaginative owner to create their dream home. Unlike many of its neighbours, the property is not listed, meaning it has the potential to be completely reimagined for a modern family.

It was named after the engraver, painter and property developer Edward Orme, who oversaw its building. Over the years it has been home to celebrated figures from culture and business, including the artist Frederic Leighton and the banker Sir Ernest Cassel. 

This property was once the home to Edward Dannreuther, a well-known pianist and writer on music. The entrance to this private square is gated, creating a peaceful and secluded setting. The open spaces of Kensington Gardens are opposite, while Queensway station is a short walk away. In addition, the many restaurants and shops of Notting Hill are within easy reach.
