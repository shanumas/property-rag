Cheyne Place leads off the eastern end of Cheyne Walk, one of the most historic streets in London. Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this street was home to numerous celebrated figures, including the writer George Eliot, the painter J.M.W. Turner, and the actress Elizabeth Taylor. To the south is the Thames Embankment, with the Albert Bridge leading to Battersea Park. To the north is the King’s Road and its excellent range of restaurants and shops. In addition, the beautiful Chelsea Physic Garden lies opposite the property.
