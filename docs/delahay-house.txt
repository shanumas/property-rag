It was constructed from red brick with Venetian stylistic influences and is now Grade II listed. Inside, there is a lift connecting each floor., 

Delahay House stands at the eastern end of Cheyne Walk, one of London’s most historic addresses, which has been home to numerous writers, artists and international figures, including George Eliot and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Today, the property is a short walk away from the King’s Road, with its celebrated range of restaurants and shops. It is also positioned close to the private Chelsea Physic Garden, while the open spaces of Battersea Park are within easy reach.,
