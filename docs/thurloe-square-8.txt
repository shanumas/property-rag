In addition, residents have keys to access the communal gardens opposite – one of the few garden squares where dogs are allowed. 

Thurloe Square is a highly sought-after garden square close to South Kensington underground station. The square was developed in the 1820s, its houses mostly designed by George Basevi, a celebrated Victorian architect of the Gothic and Neoclassical styles. From here, the neighbourhood’s many outstanding museums and cultural institutions are close. In addition, the shops and restaurants of Chelsea and Knightsbridge are a short walk away, along with the open spaces of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.
