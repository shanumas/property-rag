There is also a glazed rear terrace with views over the garden. 

Campden Hill Road runs north from Kensington High Street. Its southern half is lined with large houses set back from the street, many with stucco dressings and facades. Historically, the street was home to the novelist Ford Madox Ford and the actor Daniel Day-Lewis. From here, the restaurants, shops and underground station of Kensington High Street are within easy reach. In addition, the open spaces of both Holland Park & Kensington Gardens are a short walk away.
