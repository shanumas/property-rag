Finally, the communal parts of the building are kept in immaculate condition. 

The flat is part of a double-fronted stucco townhouse built in the mid-Victorian era. These grand villas were constructed between 1860 and 1880 by the brothers William and Francis Radford. Early residents of the street included aristocrats like the Marquess of Londonderry and the Maharajah of Lahore, as well as prominent engineers, politicians and lawyers. From here, Holland Park underground station is close, while the restaurants and shops of Notting Hill are also nearby. In addition, the open spaces of Holland Park are a few moments’ walk away.
