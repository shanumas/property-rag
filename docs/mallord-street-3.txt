The house was built in 1911 for the watercolourist Cecil Arthur Hunt. Its architect was Ralph Knott, who was best known for designing the London County Hall building. This is a perfect example of the ‘studio house’, with a large space for painting on the top floor to take full advantage of the light. 

The Neighbourhood The house was home to the world-renowned Hungarian pianist Louis Kentner. More recently, the studio space has been used to host recitals, recalling this rich cultural history. 

Mallord Street is one of Chelsea’s most charming addresses. It was named after J.M.W. Turner – Mallord was the painter’s middle name – and lined with Edwardian houses built in the Arts and Crafts style. Over the years, this street has been home to numerous creative figures, including painters, composers and writers. The most well-known of these was the author A.A. Milne, who created the Winnie the Pooh books. Mallord Street is moments away from the King’s Road, with its celebrated range of restaurants and shops. In addition, Sloane Square and South Kensington underground stations are both within walking distance Image: https://admin.russellsimpson.co.uk/images/GiX6wqtupCGHzJEJCR9-KsCP-Sw=/17166/fill-960x1440%7Cformat-webp/RUS170010__Terrace Terrace Image: https://admin.russellsimpson.co.uk/images/rnqleI-Mim34hDuOVR5lzJzxJtI=/17167/fill-960x1440%7Cformat-webp/RUS170010__Exteior Exterior Image: https://admin.russellsimpson.co.uk/images/QoQsJG3NsNtKvHbixElqBTAm3dk=/17159/fill-1440x960%7Cformat-webp/RUS170010__Studio_Drawing_Room_BxXEvbl Terrace Exterior
