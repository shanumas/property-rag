Draycott Place is a sought-after street lined with beautiful houses and mansion blocks. These buildings were constructed in the Victoria Era, imitating the distinctive gables and patterned brickwork of seventeenth-century Dutch architecture. The style became popular in Kensington and Chelsea, earning the nickname ‘Pont Street Dutch’. From here, the restaurants and shops of the King’s Road are a short walk away. In addition, Sloane Square underground station is close, along with the independent boutiques and artisanal food shops of Pavilion Road.,
