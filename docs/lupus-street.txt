Lupus Street marks the southern border of a grid of terraces designed by Thomas Cubbitt in 1825. These terraces are lined in Regency townhouses, many with stucco facades or dressings, adding to the historic feel of the neighbourhood. From here, Pimlico Station is close, while Sloane Square underground station is also nearby. A little closer is Orange Square, with its popular farmers’ market each weekend. Finally, the many restaurants and shops of the King’s Road are within walking distance.
