Its interior has been decorated to suit this distinguished history, with wooden wainscoting, marble fireplaces, and marvellous floral patterns for the wallpaper. 

The Neighbourhood Cheyne Row is a beautiful street, mixing early Georgian architecture with Victorian terraces and mansion blocks. Along with neighbouring Cheyne Walk, in the nineteenth century it was home to numerous writers and artists. The famed historian Thomas Carlyle lived next door at No.24 and his house is now a museum. Today, Cheyne Row is perfectly positioned in the heart of Old Chelsea. To the south is the Thames Embankment, with the Albert Bridge leading to Battersea Park. To the north is the King’s Road, with its excellent range of restaurants and shops. In addition, the beautiful Chelsea Physic Garden is just a short walk away.
