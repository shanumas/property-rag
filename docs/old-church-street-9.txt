Essoldo House is a modern building on the site of the former Essoldo cinema, Chelsea. Its dramatic shape evokes this history, while also housing a modern Everyman cinema. The building is exceptionally well-located on the King’s Road, with many shops and restaurants in walking distance. In addition, Old Church Street connects to the Fulham Road and Chelsea Embankment, meaning the River Thames and Battersea Park are also close.,
