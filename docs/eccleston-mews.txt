Its picturesque properties once formed the stables for the square’s grand terraces, originally constructed in the mid-nineteenth century. From here, both Sloane Square and Victoria stations are a short walk away. The exceptional restaurants and shops of the King’s Road and Knightsbridge are also close. Finally, the open spaces of Hyde Park are within easy reach.,
