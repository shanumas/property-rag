In the mid-nineteenth century, that building was replaced by the white stucco Italianate houses which now line the square, popular with aristocrats and politicians in the late Victorian Era. Kensington Gate remains a desirable address, both central and secluded. It is well placed for many of the neighbourhood’s excellent schools, and within walking distance of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. In addition, the world-famous museums and cultural institutions of South Kensington are within easy reach.,
