Montpelier Square is a beautiful and sought-after garden square in Knightsbridge. Its tall brick houses with stucco dressings were built in the nineteenth century and have been occupied by several celebrated actresses, artists and writers over the years. The exclusive restaurants and shops of Knightsbridge are a short walk away, and so too the underground station. In addition, the open spaces of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are within easy reach. Finally, the word-class cultural venues of South Kensington are nearby.
