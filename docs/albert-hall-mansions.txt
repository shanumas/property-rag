Albert Hall Mansions was designed by Norman Shaw, one of most celebrated architects of the late Victorian period. This beautiful mansion block was constructed from red brick in 1879, with an impressive central staircase, as well as a 24-hour concierge service and a lift. The mansion blocks surrounding the Royal Albert Hall were some of the first in London. They are uniquely well-positioned for the world-class cultural venues of South Kensington, as well as the celebrated restaurants and shops of Kensington High Street. In addition, the green spaces of Hyde Park are opposite the building, while South Kensington and Gloucester Road underground stations are within walking distance.,
