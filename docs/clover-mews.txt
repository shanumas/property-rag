Clover Mews is a beautiful cobbled mews in the heart of old Chelsea. Running north from the pastel-painted houses of Dilke Street, it is lined with red brick houses on one side and planted borders on the other. This property lies at the end of the mews, with a gabled facade and white dressings for the lower storey. From here, the many restaurants and shops of the Kings’ Road are within easy reach, as well as the beautiful grounds of the Chelsea Physic Garden. Albert Bridge is also a short walk away, leading to the open spaces of Battersea Park. In addition, residents have the right to apply to the impressive sports facilities of nearby Burton Court.
