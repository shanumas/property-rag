St George’s Square was designed by Thomas Cubitt as London’s only garden square open to the river. Work began in 1835 and, over the years, the square has been home to the writers Bram Stoker – creator of Dracula – and Dorothy L. Sayers. The central garden was also designed by Cubbitt, with large lawns and paved paths now open to the public. Today, the square’s grand white stucco townhouses make it a sought-after address. From here, Pimlico station is very close, positioned on the other side of the square, while the excellent sporting facilities of Dolphin Square are also nearby.
