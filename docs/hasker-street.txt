Positioned in the 'golden triangle' of SW3, this was historically market gardens and parkland. Residential development in the area started in the early 1800s and has continued leaving the area dominated by a range of attractive Victorian and Georgian terraced houses. Hasker Street is a short walk from South Kensington, Sloane Square and Knightsbridge underground stations giving you access to excellent tube links across London.
