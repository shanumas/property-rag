Radnor Walk is quiet residential street leading south from the King’s Road. The street was once home to Radnor Studios, a popular set of artists’ studios in the second half of the nineteenth century. More recently, the street was home to the poet laureate John Betjeman. From here, the many restaurants and shops of Chelsea are within easy reach, while Sloane Square station is also close. Residents have the right to apply for membership of the impressive sports facilities at nearby Burton Court.
