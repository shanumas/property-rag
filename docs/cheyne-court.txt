The Neighbourhood Cheyne Court is a red-brick mansion block from the Victorian era, with portered gates providing a high level of security. It is located close to Cheyne Row, perhaps the most historic street in London. To the south is the Thames Embankment, with the Albert Bridge leading to Battersea Park. To the north is the King’s Road, with its excellent range of restaurants and shops. The Chelsea Physic Garden is opposite, while the sporting facilities of Burton Court are close by.
