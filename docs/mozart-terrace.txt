During August and September 1764, they visited England and lodged at 180 Ebury Street. The surrounding Georgian houses were later renamed Mozart Terrace, and Grade II listed in recognition of their rich history. From here, Sloane Square underground station is a short walk away, while Victoria Station is also close. The restaurants and shops of Chelsea are within easy reach, while nearby Orange Square hosts a popular farmers’ market each weekend.
