It was redeveloped in 1997 and now offers a porter, a swimming pool, a gym and underground parking. The building’s entrance hall is especially impressive, along with the well-maintained gardens open to residents. 

Rose Square lies on the Fulham Road, within easy reach of the restaurants and shops of Chelsea. South Kensington underground station is close, along with the neighbourhood’s many world-class museums and cultural facilities.
