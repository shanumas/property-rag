Their mansard roofs and dormer windows evoke the beautiful architecture of Second Empire Paris. It centres on a public garden square and the Victorian church of St Luke’s. The square is within easy reach of West Brompton and Earl’s Court underground stations, while the restaurants and shops of the Fulham Road are also in walking distance. In addition, Brompton Cemetery is nearby, with its magnificent tombs and avenues of trees.
