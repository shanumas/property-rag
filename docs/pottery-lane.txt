This area once consisted of brickfields, which were fired in the large kilns lining the road, to provide building materials for London’s rapid growth. These days, the street is well located, with Holland Park underground station a short walk away. In addition, the open spaces of Holland Park itself are within easy reach, while the many restaurants and independent shops of Notting Hill are also close by.,
