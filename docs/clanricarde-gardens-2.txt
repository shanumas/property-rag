Clanricarde Gardens was built between 1869 and 1873 by Thomas Good and William White. The tall Victorian houses lining the street have stucco bases and window dressings. Today is it a quiet but conveniently positioned cul-de-sac. From here, Queensway station is close, and so too the open spaces of Kensington Gardens. In addition, the restaurants and shops of Notting Hill are a short walk away.
