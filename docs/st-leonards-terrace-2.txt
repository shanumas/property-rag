In the late nineteenth century the neighbourhood was popular with artists and writers: Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, lived just a few doors down. Today, it is one of the most desirable addresses in south-west London, with views across the parkland and pitches of Burton Court. In addition, the shops and restaurants of the King’s Road are a short walk away, while Sloane Square underground station is within easy reach.
